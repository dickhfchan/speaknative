# Feature Specification: Native American Accent Learning App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building an iOS app which help english learner to solve the accent problem so they can speak native american accent English. Here is how it works. The app will give a short narrative to the user first, then the user will speak the narrative. The app records the voice of the user and analysis the voice by comparing it to the voice of a native speak speaking the same narrative. Once the app indentify the issues or mistake of the user's voice. The app shows the issues to the user and recommend a to-learn list for the user. The to-learn should have the fro single word execrise, phrase execrise to sentences execrise. If the user failed in any one of the execrise, more execrises with similar will be given, Until the user fix the issue, then he /she can move on to the next execrise planned."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An English learner opens the app and wants to improve their American accent. The app presents them with a short narrative to read aloud. After recording their speech, the app analyzes their pronunciation against a native speaker's version, identifies specific accent issues, and creates a personalized learning path with targeted exercises to help them improve.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the app for the first time, **When** they tap "Start Learning", **Then** the app presents a short narrative for them to read
2. **Given** a user is reading a narrative, **When** they tap the record button and speak, **Then** the app records their voice and processes it
3. **Given** the app has analyzed the user's speech, **When** the analysis is complete, **Then** the app displays identified accent issues and recommended exercises
4. **Given** a user is working through exercises, **When** they complete an exercise successfully, **Then** they can proceed to the next exercise
5. **Given** a user fails an exercise, **When** they don't meet the success criteria, **Then** the app provides additional similar exercises until they improve

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's microphone is not available or permission is denied?
- How does the system handle background noise or unclear speech?
- What happens when the voice analysis fails or takes too long?
- How does the app handle users who speak too quietly or too loudly?
- What happens when the user wants to retry a narrative or exercise?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
