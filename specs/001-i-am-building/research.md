# Research Findings: Native American Accent Learning App

## Azure OpenAI SDK Integration

**Decision**: Use Azure OpenAI REST API with custom Swift wrapper
**Rationale**: 
- Azure OpenAI provides state-of-the-art speech analysis capabilities
- REST API offers better control over request/response handling
- Custom wrapper allows for offline fallback and error handling
- Better integration with iOS networking patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK: Limited to basic speech-to-text
- OpenAI API directly: Higher costs, less enterprise features
- Local ML models: Insufficient accuracy for pronunciation analysis

## Voice Recording with AVFoundation

**Decision**: Use AVAudioRecorder with high-quality settings
**Rationale**:
- AVAudioRecorder provides native iOS audio recording
- Supports various audio formats (AAC, WAV)
- Built-in noise reduction and echo cancellation
- Seamless integration with iOS permissions

**Alternatives considered**:
- AVAudioEngine: More complex, overkill for simple recording
- Third-party libraries: Additional dependencies
- WebRTC: Not suitable for local recording

## Speech Analysis Accuracy

**Decision**: Target 85%+ accuracy for pronunciation analysis
**Rationale**:
- Based on research showing 80-90% accuracy for pronunciation assessment
- Balances accuracy with response time requirements
- Sufficient for identifying major accent issues
- Can be improved with user feedback loops

**Alternatives considered**:
- 95%+ accuracy: Too slow for real-time feedback
- 70% accuracy: Too low for meaningful learning

## Core Data Model Design

**Decision**: Single Core Data stack with relationships
**Rationale**:
- Core Data provides robust local persistence
- Relationships handle complex learning progress tracking
- Built-in migration support for schema changes
- Optimized for iOS performance

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite directly: More complex, less iOS integration
- Realm: Additional dependency
- UserDefaults: Not suitable for complex data

## Offline-First Architecture

**Decision**: Local-first with cloud sync when available
**Rationale**:
- Core functionality works without internet
- Azure OpenAI calls only when connectivity available
- Local storage for all user progress
- Graceful degradation for offline mode

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cloud-first: Poor user experience without internet
- Hybrid approach: Too complex for initial version

## Performance Requirements

**Decision**: <2s voice analysis, 60fps UI, <100MB app size
**Rationale**:
- 2s analysis time provides good user experience
- 60fps ensures smooth UI interactions
- 100MB keeps app size reasonable for download

**Alternatives considered**:
- <1s analysis: Too expensive, requires local processing
- 30fps UI: Poor user experience on modern devices
- 200MB+ app: Too large for casual users

## Security and Privacy

**Decision**: Local audio processing with encrypted storage
**Rationale**:
- User voice data stays on device when possible
- Encrypted Core Data storage for sensitive data
- Azure OpenAI calls only for analysis, not storage
- Clear privacy policy for data usage

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cloud storage: Privacy concerns
- No encryption: Security risk
- Full local processing: Insufficient accuracy
