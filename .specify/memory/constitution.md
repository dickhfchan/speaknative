# SpeakNative Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### I. User-First Design
Every feature must prioritize user learning outcomes; Interface must be intuitive for non-native English speakers; Accessibility standards mandatory for inclusive learning

### II. SwiftUI Architecture
Modern iOS development using SwiftUI; MVVM pattern for clean separation of concerns; Combine for reactive data flow; Core Data for local persistence

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Unit tests for all business logic

### IV. Progressive Learning
Content must be structured in difficulty levels; Adaptive learning paths based on user performance; Spaced repetition for vocabulary retention; Clear progress tracking

### V. Offline-First
Core functionality works without internet; Local data storage for user progress; Sync capabilities when connectivity available; Graceful degradation for offline mode

## Technical Requirements

- iOS 15.0+ minimum deployment target
- Swift 5.7+ for modern language features
- SwiftUI for UI implementation
- Core Data for local storage
- Combine for reactive programming
- XCTest for unit testing
- Accessibility compliance (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)

## Development Workflow

- Feature branches for all development
- Code review required for all PRs
- Automated testing on CI/CD
- Manual testing on multiple device sizes
- Performance testing for smooth 60fps UI

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified with learning value
